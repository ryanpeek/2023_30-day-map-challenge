### Day-03

Words for pollywog or tadpole across the world. The etymology may be rooted in Middle English, where `tadpole` is from *tadde* “toad” and *pol* “head”. For  `pollywog`, it's possibly from the *pol* "head" and *wyglen* “to wiggle”.

Expert sources were the internet, wikipedia, and dictionaries.

### Day-04

Timezones are scary. Having to switch our clocks twice a year is scarier.

### Day-07

Maps tell stories as well as help one navigate. While we have many maps of post-colonial trails, it is much harder to find data that documents Indigenous places, trails, and knowledge. It is not that these don't exist, they just don't get put on maps. 

A recent effort to provide an interactive GIS map of indigenous resources to help advance knowledge of Indigenous ancestral lands is called [Native Lands National Trails](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c98b415eb4b44081a6dcb9e824785846/page/NLNT-Homepage/). This is in part to help advance National Trails System knowledge of Indigenous ancestral Lands and increase partnerships and collaboration with Indigenous Communities along National Scenic and National Historic Trails.

I highly recommend checking out the map and reading the resources section and read the acknowledgement statement.^[Also look at the beautiful logo designed by Autry Lomahongva!].

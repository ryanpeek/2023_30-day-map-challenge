### Day-03

Words for pollywog or tadpole across the world. The etymology may be rooted in Middle English, where `tadpole` is from *tadde* “toad” and *pol* “head”. For  `pollywog`, it's possibly from the *pol* "head" and *wyglen* “to wiggle”.

Expert sources were the internet, wikipedia, and dictionaries.
